# Name of the workflow
name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the main and stable branches
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, stable ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, stable ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # Main building and testing
  build-test:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Define the platforms to run on. Later determines the Docker image that'll be used
